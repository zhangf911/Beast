/** Parse some HTTP/1 message data from a stream.

    This function synchronously advances the state of the
    parser using the provided dynamic buffer and reading
    from the input stream as needed. The call will block
    until one of the following conditions is true:

    @li When expecting a message header, and the complete
        header is received.

    @li When expecting a chunk header, and the complete
        chunk header is received.

    @li When expecting body octets, one or more body octets
        are received.

    @li An error occurs in the stream or parser.

    This function is implemented in terms of one or more calls
    to the stream's `read_some` function. The implementation may
    read additional octets that lie past the end of the object
    being parsed. This additional data is stored in the dynamic
    buffer, which may be used in subsequent calls.

    @param stream The stream from which the data is to be read.
    The type must support the @b SyncReadStream concept.

    @param dynabuf A @b DynamicBuffer holding additional bytes
    read by the implementation from the stream. This is both
    an input and an output parameter; on entry, any data in the
    dynamic buffer's input sequence will be given to the parser
    first.

    @param parser The parser to use.

    @return The number of bytes processed from the dynamic
    buffer. The caller should remove these bytes by calling
    `consume` on the dynamic buffer.

    @throws system_error Thrown on failure.

/** Start an asynchronous operation to parse some HTTP/1 message data from a stream.

    This function asynchronously advances the state of the
    parser using the provided dynamic buffer and reading from
    the input stream as needed. The function call always
    returns immediately. The asynchronous operation will
    continue until one of the following conditions is true:

    @li When expecting a message header, and the complete
        header is received.

    @li When expecting a chunk header, and the complete
        chunk header is received.

    @li When expecting body octets, one or more body octets
        are received.

    @li An error occurs in the stream or parser.

    This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to
    the next layer's `async_read_some` function, and is known as a
    <em>composed operation</em>. The program must ensure that the
    stream performs no other operations until this operation completes.
    The implementation may read additional octets that lie past the
    end of the object being parsed. This additional data is stored
    in the stream buffer, which may be used in subsequent calls.

    The completion handler will be called with the number of bytes
    processed from the dynamic buffer. The caller should remove
    these bytes by calling `consume` on the dynamic buffer.

    @param stream The stream from which the data is to be read.
    The type must support the @b AsyncReadStream concept.

    @param dynabuf A @b DynamicBuffer holding additional bytes
    read by the implementation from the stream. This is both
    an input and an output parameter; on entry, any data in the
    dynamic buffer's input sequence will be given to the parser
    first.

    @param parser The parser to use.

    @param handler The handler to be called when the request
    completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required.
    The equivalent function signature of the handler must be:
    @code void handler(
        error_code const& error,    // result of operation
        std::size_t bytes_used      // the number of bytes to consume
    ); @endcode
    Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes
    immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within
    this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a
    manner equivalent to using `boost::asio::io_service::post`.
